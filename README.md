Assignment for the Natural Computing course - Computer Science (BSc) Leiden University 2021/2022.

The assignment consisted of the development of a Genetic Algorithm to solve the inverting problem of few Cellular Automata (ie, given the CA rule and the number of possible states of each cell, find an initial state such that, after a given number of steps, produce the given final state) and a performance assesment of the algorithm.  

The original work was done by myself, Jasper Kooij and Oda Aggerholm.
